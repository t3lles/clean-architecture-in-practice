# clean-architecture-in-practice
Clean Architecture project developed during the Clean Architecture in Practice course on balta.io. This repository demonstrates the implementation of layered architecture, SOLID principles, dependency inversion, and best practices using .NET.

# Clean Architecture - .NET Project

This project was developed during the **Clean Architecture in Practice** course from balta.io.

## 📚 About

The goal of this project is to apply Clean Architecture principles in a real-world .NET application, focusing on:

- Separation of concerns
- SOLID principles
- Dependency inversion
- Domain-driven structure
- Layered organization
- Maintainability and scalability

## 🏗 Architecture Structure

The solution is organized into layers:

- **Domain** – Business rules and core entities
- **Application** – Use cases and business logic orchestration
- **Infrastructure** – Database access and external services
- **API** – Entry point (Controllers / Endpoints)

This structure ensures low coupling and high cohesion, making the system easier to test and maintain.

## 🛠 Technologies

- .NET 8
- C#
- Entity Framework Core
- SQL Server
- MediatR (if applicable)
- Dependency Injection

## 🎯 Purpose

This repository is part of my continuous learning journey, aiming to strengthen my software architecture skills and apply best practices in real-world scenarios.
